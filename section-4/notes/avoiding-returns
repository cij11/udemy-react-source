Only ever have 1 return statement in the render method. 

This is so that if we are going to change our top level element, we only have to change it in one place.



Class component
Initialise: state = { activeIndex: 0}
Reference: this.state.activeIndex
Update: this.setState({activeIndex : 10})

Functional component
Initalize: [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0)
Reference: activeIndex
Update: setActiveIndex(10)

Note that if you have multiple pieces of state, you need to call useState once for each value.
If you update multiple pieces of state, need to call each setter.
