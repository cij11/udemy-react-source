JS file loaded by browser
Instance of App component is created
App components 'constructor' function gets called
State object is created and assigned to the 'this.state' property
We call geolocation service
React calls the component's render method
App returns JSX, gets rendered as HTML
We get result of geolocationWe update our state object with a call to this.setState
Updating a state property (almost) instantly re-renders the component
We get the results of geolocation.


So, component was actually rendered twice
