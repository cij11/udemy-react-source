Component Lifecycle

Constructor
render
 - Component visible on screen
 componentDidMount (place to do initial data loading)
 - Sit and wait for updates
 componentDidUpdate (might be a place to do data loading in response to state changing)
 - Sit amnd wait until this component is no longer shown
 componentWillUnmount


 We could use constructor or componentDidMount to do data loading. 
 But, standards recommend doing data loading in 'componentDidMount'.
