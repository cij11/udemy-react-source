Time progresses down page

JS file loaded by browser
App component gets created
We call geolocation service
App returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML
...
...
We get results of geolocation! _After_ page has loaded.

Without hooks, we need to use a class based component in order to take advantage of state and lifecycle.



Updated diagram:

JS file loaded by browser
App component gets created
We call geolocation service
App returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML
...
...
We get results of geolocation! _After_ page has loaded.
Tell the component to rerender itself wiht the results of geolocation


Rules of Class Components:
Must be a Javascript classMust extend React.Component
Must define a 'render' method that returns some amount of JSX


Remember, classes are not classical classes. They rely on prototypal inheritance.
