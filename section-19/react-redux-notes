React-redux lets redux work nicely with react.  

Store
 - Reducers  -> Provider (wraps app) 
             -> app
             -> Connect
             -> Data from Store


So Provider has a reference to the store.
Provides information to components inside of app

connect subscribes to changes in the store for what is connected.
